# Caterpillar-Snake-like-Game-
The Caterpillar Game is a fun and interactive arcade-style game where players control a caterpillar that moves around the screen, growing longer as it eats food while avoiding obstacles and its own body. The game is similar to the classic Snake Game, where the caterpillar continuously moves in a chosen direction.
